# mixmatch

This is a collaborative 3-person group project involving the development of a full-stack application via psql and Django, with HTML/CSS/Javascript design on the front end. The initial purpose of this app was to create an application that could filter user-entered ingredients with a list of drinks that have their own ingredients, but it was reduced to a drink creation and review page to meet a more viable app, with intentions to add on the initially desired functionality later.
