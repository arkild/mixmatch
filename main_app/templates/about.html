        Our app takes the guesswork out of mixology, offering a simple yet sophisticated solution. As part of our MVP, you can explore ingredient lists and discover cocktails related to singular ingredients. But we don't stop there - as a stretch goal, we're working to display drinks that match your exact ingredient list. For example, if you possess vodka, Cointreau, Cranberry juice, lime juice, and Jack Danielâ€™s, our app will pinpoint cocktails like the Cosmopolitan and Cape Cod that you can concoct with ease.
